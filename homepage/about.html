    <h1>Hi, my name is Gulnur</h1>
    <p>I am 19 years old, 3rd year student at KIMEP university majoring in Information Systems.
        I really do dislike web development and designing things but people keep telling me that
        I am good at it... <br><br> Despite the praise I receive for my abilities in web development and design, my personal affinity for these areas remains lacking.
        I find myself disinterested and uninspired when engaging with the creative aspects of design, and the intricacies of web development
        often leave me feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. While I acknowledge the recognition I receive from others, I believe it is crucial to
        align my career aspirations with my genuine passions and strengths. Exploring alternative avenues within the broad realm of Information Systems
        that cater to my interests will undoubtedly lead to a more fulfilling and gratifying professional journey.</p>
        <div class="mydiv"><img src="images/iconm.jpg" width="600px" height="600px"></div>

    <h3>I have many hobbies</h3>
    <p>My main hobbies are reading books, playing computer games (i play valorant, genshin, mobile legends,
                and witcher3). I'm into crossfit lately so I am hoping to be buffed next year. I watch
                anime (my favourite is naruto) and try my best at learning languages. People also tell me that I'm good at writing
                so I will soon test my abilities by writing something fun. <br><br> One peculiar aspect of my interests is my inclination towards villains. Whether it's in books, movies, or games, I often find myself drawn to the complexity and depth that well-crafted antagonists bring to a story. Their motivations, flaws, and the conflicts they generate fascinate me, offering a unique perspective on the narratives I encounter. It's an unconventional preference, but one that adds a layer of intrigue to my engagement with various forms of media.</p>

    <h3>My biggest dream is to be a gamedev and to see bts live</h3>
    <p> I have many dreams but my main career dream is to become a game devolemep. My personal dream
        is to one day go to a BTS concert. They are my inspiration and support and I dream to see and listen to them live <br><br>
        I often find myself envisioning the vibrant atmosphere of a BTS concert, surrounded by thousands of passionate fans, singing along to every lyric and experiencing a profound sense of unity. The thought of being in the same space as the members, hearing their powerful vocals and witnessing their mesmerizing choreography, sends shivers down my spine. It's not just about the music; it's about connecting with fellow fans, sharing the love for BTS, and celebrating the impact they have had on our lives.</p>

    <h1><br><br>It was very nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p> If you think that my writing style is strange that's because every parapgraph on this website except for Alchemist review was written by chat gpt. But thanks for reading it </p>
